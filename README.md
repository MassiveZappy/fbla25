This is a Personal Finance Tracker for student's (and others).

It allows multiple users who can each create accounts and login to the website.

It includes sign up, login, logout, home, dashboard, FAQ, etc pages.

The website supports lists of transactions, filtering transactions (by date, amount, name), and creating "events" of either income or spending to add to the transactional lists.

This allows for descriptions to be attached to both the transactional lists and individual events.

The dashboard can display balances of transaction lists and filtered lists as well as the total account balance.

And more...
